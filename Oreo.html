    <h1>Our Dog, Oreo</h1>
    <h2>Past</h2>
    <p>Oreo was born May 22nd, and was originally under the care of my grandpa, Jose. My auntie had gone to visit family in California and brought Oreo to us, here in Oregon.</p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Oreo is a black and white, like the oreo cookie, Chihuahua-Rat Terrier mix. His daily routine consists of:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Sleeping</li>
      <li>Eating</li>
      <li>Playing in his Snoopy bed</li>
      <li>And scratching everyone to get attention</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Thanks for taking the time to read about our dog, Oreo!</p>
